Below is a link to my github page and documents relating to preprocessing and querying of the data written in r markdown which can also be found on the github page.

[Data Preprocessing](http://rpubs.com/alunmeredith/134413)

The pipeline of the data was the following processes: 
  * Downloading and extracting the data
  * Type conversion of file types
  * Moving tweets and coordinates found in the wrong variable to the correct place, replacing with NA values.
  * Changing negative values for "id_member" to positive equivalent.
